# Iot-Based-Manhole-monitoring

Manhole monitoring is crucial for urban infrastructure management, as accidents and flooding caused by broken or missing manhole covers are common issues. In this project, we'll build an IoT-based Manhole Monitoring Device using various sensors to detect gas presence, water level, and manhole cover tilt. If any of these values exceed predefined thresholds, an SMS notification will be sent to an authority number using the SIM800L GSM Module. The system will be powered by an 18650 cell.
